# NLP Preprocess Website 📝

A comprehensive web-based tool designed to streamline the text preprocessing stage of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This application allows users to input raw text and apply various cleaning and normalization techniques to prepare data for machine learning models or analysis.

> **Note:** This project was built with the assistance of **Google AI Studio**.

## 🚀 Features

This application offers a user-friendly interface to perform the following preprocessing tasks:

* **Text Cleaning:** Removes special characters, punctuation, URLs, and emojis.
* **Case Folding:** Converts all text to lowercase for uniformity.
* **Tokenization:** Splits text into individual words or sentences.
* **Stopword Removal:** Filters out common words (e.g., "and", "the", "is") that add little semantic value.
* **Stemming/Lemmatization:** Reduces words to their root form (e.g., "running" → "run").
* **Number Removal:** Strips numerical digits from the text.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **NLP Libraries:** NLTK / Spacy / TextBlob
* **Web Framework:** Streamlit (or Flask/Django)
* **Development Assistant:** Google AI Studio
